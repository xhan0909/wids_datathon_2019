Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2019

The datathon task is to train a model that takes as input a satellite image and outputs a prediction of how likely it is that the image contains an oil palm plantation. Labeled training and test datasets are provided for model development; you will then upload your predictions for an unlabeled test set to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, and the final winners of the competition.

## Final Score on Private LB:
